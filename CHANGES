[UNRELEASED]
- fixed bug where pixels outside specified region were sometimes drawn
- fixed errors in GraphDrawerTest caused by GraphDrawerDrawable fields being set to private
- added methods to colour vertices of filled rectangles

[2.2.0]
- adds GraphDrawer and GraphDrawerDrawable
- adds graph drawing to tests
- a few extra filledTriangle methods
- corrections for some minor documentation errors
- fixed filledRectangle(Rectangle rect) calling rectangle()

[2.1.0]
- added line to build.gradle to set src/ directory to act as a resources directory, for better GWT dependency management
- added ability to colour endpoints of lines, and blend polygons and ellipses from a colour at the centre to a colour at the perimeter

[2.0.3]
- fixed bug where filledRectangle() didn't push to the batch, so subsequent drawer calls could produce incorrect results

[2.0.2]
- fixed bug where triangles short[] array was not big enough
- fixed bug where vertices array was nto big enough for very large shapes, it now resizes if needed

[2.0.1]
- added setColor(r,g,b,a) method
- fixed texture coordinate bug where sometimes incorrect region of texture was used for drawing

[2.0.0]
- removed PolygonShapeDrawer class, ShapeDrawer can draw filled shapes but does so in a way depending on the type of batch provided. This is a breaking change from the previous version
- large internal refactor, reduced visibility of some internal methods (from protected to package-private)
- fixed bug with arc() where certain angles would produce artifacts

[1.3.0]
- added PolygonShapeDrawer, which can draw filled shapes for regular polygons (which includes circles and ellipses) and rectangles

[1.2.0]
- fixed path bug when consecutive points had a coordinate in common
- vertex information is cached in a large float[] instead of being sent every time a quad is calculated
- added path arguments for paths defined by float[]s and FloatArrays

[1.1.0]
- Added HTML5 support.
- Added ShapeDrawerDrawable to allow shape drawing in Scene2D UI's.

[1.0.0]
- initial code
